# Slide In Drawer Demo

For me this is the most straightforward way of implementing a slide-in menu. 

Just make MenuPresentingViewController as the base class of your ViewController, embed it inside a UINavigationController and you're all set.

The SlideInTransition class is taken from https://github.com/gtokman/Slide-In-Transition
